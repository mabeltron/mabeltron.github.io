A home backup service that allows unlimited storage seemed too good to be true and sure enough, [Crashplan](https://www.crashplanpro.com) announced that they were discontinuing their home service last week, offering only small business and enterprise plans in future and offering existing home users a discounted Pro plan or migration to [Carbonite](https://www.carbonite.com), a similar home backup service who also offered a discount.

I decided to stick with Crashplan as the deal was pretty good: honouring the outstanding subscription and changing to a monthly per machine plan with a good discount that still made it attractive, and gives me enough time to organise my local backups to make the offsite service usable in 2019. The transition was a little confusing but seems to have worked so I'm happy for the moment that I have an offsite backup.

However, this underlines my general experience of domestic offsite backup services: don't put your trust in them as they don't last. One of Crashplan Home's features was peer-to-peer backup so you and a friend could organise offsite backups with each other using the Crashplan app, which, I suspect, was one of the reasons why the service was terminated, that the service had some overhead for Crashplan without any advantage. I have also seen reports of Crashplan terminating service abruptly if payment failed or was otherwise missed in a very small window.

The general lesson is to ensure that you have a couple of layers of protection: a local NAS or backup server for immediate recovery and a method of offsite backup if that dies or is destroyed or stolen or whatever. Some kind of integrated service would be ideal but at the moment, it isn't quite there. I'm sure I'll return to this again.
