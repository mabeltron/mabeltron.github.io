As this question comes up so often on [Quora][8d81e098] I'm going to save myself a lot of time and write a piece about my thoughts on the flavour of desktop [GNU/Linux][5e3261bb] that is right for you.

In short, try as many as you want. There, that was easy. The guiding principle of GNU/Linux is that it is free. Free to use, free to modify and free to experiment with as you want. Using many distributions, including all variants of [Ubuntu][1aa7a1b2] is a simple as downloading an ISO, writing it to a USB key (or even burning it to a DVD) and booting it from a computer. If you've done this properly, you will have a fully functional desktop to explore and decide whether you like it.

In addition, think of it like this: what you are looking at is one of a small number of desktop types, on top of one of a small number of core distributions and the variations are mostly stylistic and as such based on functional and design considerations. [Ubuntu][1aa7a1b2] is a group of desktops based around [Debian][241be6f1] and the apt package manager. [Fedora][3df774b2] is based on the yum package manager with a default Gnome 3 desktop but a range of community provided [spins][8f34bd06] that offer other common desktops.

More experienced users could consider [Debian][241be6f1], [Arch][8fd9bce6] or [Gentoo][40e0f969] based desktops. These distributions require a little more work and some experience with Linux (although Debian now offers to install a desktop when you install it). Arch in particular starts with a basic setup and walks you through the whole process of creating a system from partitioning the disk to choosing your kernel and desktop.

Personally I find that too much work - I like GNU/Linux because it's as easy to set up as you want it to be, and distros such as stock Ubuntu and variations make that very easy indeed on most standard hardware. My distribution of choice is [Xubuntu][eefce8b0], which uses the XFCE desktop. I do some customisation to make it look how I want, which is also pretty easy. It's also a lot lighter than, say, stock Ubuntu, and while I run a ridiculously overpowered laptop now, it's what I have become used to. But don't take it from me.
